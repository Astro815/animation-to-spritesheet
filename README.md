# Animation to SpriteSheet

## How to convert (Step by Step)
1. First add your animations in the `./input` folder. (See the section **How to Add animations**)
2. Run the `main.py` file, or run `init.bat`.
3. Enter the name of the animation.
4. Wait for the conversion process, and that's it! 

Your sprite sheet will be in the `./output` folder.

## How to Add animations
There are two ways to place your animation here.

### 1 - GIFs:
Export your animation in ".gif", and place it here in this "/input" folder

### 2 - Folders (Separate animation):
You can export your animation into several images/frames and place them in a single folder. (the folder name is the animation name)

### Recommendation:
**If you are going to place animations in folders:** it is recommended that the images have their names like `name_frameIndex`, example: `dog_003.png`

> # Attention:
> For now ALL animations must be the same size, The dimensions of "animation A" must be the same as "animation B".
