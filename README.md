## How to Add animations
There are two ways to place your animation here.

### 1 - GIFs:
Export your animation in .gif, and place it here in this "/input" folder

### 2 - Folders (Separate animation):
You can export your animation into several images/frames and place them in a single folder. (the folder name is the animation name)

### Recommendation:
**If you are going to place animations in folders:** it is recommended that the images have their names like `name_frameIndex`, example: `dog_003.png`

> # Attention:
> For now ALL animations must be the same size, The dimensions of "animation A" must be the same as "animation B".
